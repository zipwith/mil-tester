# mil-tester : A test suite for mil-tools

This repository contains a rough first cut at a tester suite for
mil-tools (https://github.com/habit-lang/mil-tools).  It is
cobbled together from assorted old tests for MIL and LC together
with a small number of new tests.  Some details in the ways that
this test suite has been configured were motivated more by the
goal of testing the implementation of tester than by the goal of
testing mil-tools.  I hope this will be a good starting point for a
more substantial test suite, but there is much room here for
rationalizing, reorganizing, and expanding the current version.

Basic requirements and instructions for use:

* Download and install `tester` (`git clone https://github.com/zipwith/tester.git`).

* Download and install `mil-tools` (`git clone https://github.com/habit-lang/mil-tools`) in a parallel repository (i.e., in `../mil-tools`).

* Run the tests by using `tester -r main`.

* Check the documentation for `tester` for basic information about how test cases are defined, and then follow the examples in the `main` folder to create new test cases.  (Note that it may be easier to create a new set of test cases, keeping `main` as a reference instead of modifying it directly.)
